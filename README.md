Connect 4 Algorithm with Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm. It's still in very early stages and will be updated as I optimize and edit the code. Right now, you play as P1, by entering a number 0-6 to move on the board.

You can change the number of iterations and board simulations per one iteration. 

The bot is still a little dumb, so I'm still working on teaching it good moves.
